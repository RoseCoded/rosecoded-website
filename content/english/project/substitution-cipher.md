## Simple Web App

Our customer needed a simple tool to apply a classic substitution cipher in order to generate text for a fictional webcomic world. In addition to applying three such ciphers, the user has the option of copying the text to their clipboard with the click of a button.

## Our Work

We developed the website using Hugo and built the simple interface using basic CSS. The functionality is written in Javascript.
