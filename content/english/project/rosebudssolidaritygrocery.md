## Grocery Delivery Website Design & Development

Rosebuds Solidarity Grocery is your Portland, Oregon grocery delivery service. Their mission is to safely deliver high-quality food to consumers at lower prices. They provide a living wage, and stable employment to our worker owners by organizing as a worker-consumer cooperative. Their company is managed by the collective of worker members â€“ all worker members have an equal vote in management decisions.

## Our Work
We developed the core e-commerce website which allows users to add items to a virtual shopping cart, checkout, and pay for their order by debit/credit card. Worker/owners can login to manage orders, track inventory, and report on financials.
