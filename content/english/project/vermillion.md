## Progressive Web App

Vermillion is a budgeting platform that allows users to track their expenses and maximize their savings rate. It includes user authorization, Google ads, and premium subscriptions (using Stripe). Using this tool, folks can plan out every dollar to make sure they are prioritizing their money.

## Our Work

We developed the core application and ported it to Android for upload to the Google Play Store. This includes a Realtime Database to keep track of users, their budgets, and their expenses. 

Additionally users are added to a MailChimp mailing list for updated emails about their budget. 

Lastly, we set up social media automation for Pinterest (using Tailwind), Instagram (using Zapier and Airtable), and Facebook (using IFTTT). These tools allow the client to organize content and schedule it ahead of time for free.
