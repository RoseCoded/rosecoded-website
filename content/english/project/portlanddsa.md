## Portland DSA Design & Development

The Democratic Socialists of America is the United Statesâ€™ largest socialist organization with over 55,000 members currently. As of February 2020, the Portland chapter has over 1,100 members. There are now DSA chapters in more than 60 urban and rural regions across the country, with more forming every day.

## Our Work
We developed and maintain the chapter's website which includes a member portal, contact database, and various connections to third party tools. We also handle the organization's hosting and other I.T. needs.
