## Campaign Website with Blog, Mailing List, and Donations

Universal Preschool NOW! is a coalition of parents, child care providers, preschool workers, unions, and community groups who understand that universal preschool is a fundamental part of the fight for social, racial, and economic justice. They helped pass Measure 26-214 (Preschool for All), a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Multnomah County families.



In 2020, their campaign was successful! Measure 26-214 ensures Multnomah County families have access to free preschool for every 3- and 4-year-old while guaranteeing preschool workers a living wage. 

## Our Work


We developed the website that was used as a focus point of the campaign, centralizing information and faciliating donations. UpNow was also able to maintain a mailing list and active blog to keep their participants up to date and organize collective action.
